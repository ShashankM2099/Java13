First imported java.util.Random;
written the author, version and description of the assignment
IN the main method, declared and initialized few variables such as int(wins,loss,rounds, dices, and rolls).
Thought it'd be best to use a for-loop for 100,00 rounds.
Starting with int i=0 and end value to be 100,000.
In my method. I called roll.
Initliazed and declared a new random generator called random. 
For two dices.
Used if's, elif's and else statement's in this project.
If score equals 7 or 11
You win a point in both rolls, and when you do. Rolls, round, and WINS get a +1
If score equals 2,3 or 11..YOU LOSE
and also rolls, round and LOSS get a +1
When there's a draw, before the round is over. Added a while loop in else statement.
When score equals point you WIN. and all get a +1
When score equals before 7..round is over and all get a +1 in counting. 
When done. The output prints with each round, with two dies, giving what each die scored
total score of both dies, and who won. The number of wins and losses in said total rounds.
